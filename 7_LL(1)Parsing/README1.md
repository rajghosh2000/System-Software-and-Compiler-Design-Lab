Take a sample grammar, such as the simple unambiguous arithmetic expression grammar E-<E+T|T, ....><br>
(a) Write routines to compute the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for the non-terminals of the grammar.
     Define appropriate data structure to store the grammar and the FIRST and FOLLOW sets.

(b) Write a LL(1) parser for the grammar.
     Define the data-structure for the Parsing Table and initialize it manually in the program. Define the parser stack. Implement a lexical analyser and write parser routine.
