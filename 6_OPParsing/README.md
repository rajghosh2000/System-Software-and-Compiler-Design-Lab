# Assignmnet 6 Operator Precedence Parsing

Implement a desk calculator using operator precedence parsing.
Define a language for simple arithmetic expressions that can contain numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and brackets. Create an operator precedence table and fill it manually with the conventional notions of precedence and associativity of the arithmetic operators. For computing the value of an input expression, you will have to implement a stack. There will be three types of elements in the stack- numeric values (operands), operators, and precedence relations. The program should be able to read the stack contents properly.
